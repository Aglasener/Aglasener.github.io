    <header>The Aphid</header>

    <p>The aphid is an astonishing creature. It is both a focus of fascination for entmologists and a bane to gardners and farmers. Their adaptability and symbiotic relationships, have allowed them to flourish across the world. </p>
    <p>Two examples of their capabilities are: their ability to asexually produce, creating clones of themselves when no mates are available, and to produce offspring with wings when a trigger is tripped by environmental factors</p>
